# Inventory Management Optimization
Overview
ABC Ltd. ( a dummy company) is confronted with the significant challenge of maintaining optimal inventory levels while adapting to constantly shifting customer demands. Excess inventory ties up capital and leads to increased holding costs, while stockouts can result in lost sales and diminished customer trust. This project explores strategies for ABC Ltd to optimize its inventory management, aiming to reduce overstock and synchronize supply with market demand, thereby maximizing gross sales and profit margins.

Objectives
•	Develop strategies to reduce overstock and align inventory levels with market demand.
•	Identify and implement practices to increase gross sales and profit margins.
•	Assess the relationship between inventory management practices and overstock levels, gross sales, and profit margins.
•	Assess how discounts and order quantities influence gross sales and profit margins.

Methodology
This project employs a mixed-methods approach, integrating quantitative data analysis from GitHub with advanced forecasting techniques like AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average with eXogenous (ARIMAX) to improve demand prediction accuracy. The tools used include Python for data cleaning and SAS for exploratory data analysis (EDA), modeling, and forecasting.
